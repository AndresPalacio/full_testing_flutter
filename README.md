# Flutter App's simplest automated full test

This project shows an example of the main forms of automated testing in Flutter mobile App, being:

- [Unitary][] (including [mocking][] on unitary);
- [Widgets][];
- [Integration][] (or assertion).

Using native libraries or recommended by official Flutter documentation (Google).

> Note that everything here fits within the guidelines set out in [Effective Dart][].

[Unitary]: https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction
[mocking]: https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking
[Widgets]: https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/widget/introduction
[Integration]: https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction
[Effective Dart]: https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/effective-dart

## Prerequisites

You will need [Flutter][] framework 1.9.1+hotfix.6 or above installed.

> The Dart SDK **is not required** because Flutter has _[Dart language][]_ support as an integrated tool in the framework.

[Flutter]: https://flutter.dev/
[Dart language]: https://dart.dev/

**Libraries:**

- [test][] 1.6.3
- [provider][] 3.1.0+1
- [pedantic][] 1.8.0+1 (dev)

[test]: https://pub.dev/packages/test
[provider]: https://pub.dev/packages/provider
[pedantic]: https://pub.dev/packages/pedantic

## Running tests

To test the project, run:

    flutter test

To check test coverage, run:

    flutter test --coverage
    genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html

> The `flutter test --coverage` command will generate a `lcov.info` file, you will need to install the [LCOV][] program to convert (`genhtml ...`) the report to an HTML file (human readable).
